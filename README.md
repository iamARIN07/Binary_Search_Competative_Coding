# Binary Search(BS) : Coding Solutions & Practice

I will be coding the basic, intermediate and Advance qustions on Binary Search. 
The questions are normally found in competative coding & Hackathons. 
I have listed the most famous and common topics here and will be solving them in my way.
The codes are written as custom python functions

1) Finding element in a sorted Array(asc).py : You have to find the given element in a ascending order array.
2) Finding element in a sorted Array(desc).py : You have to find the given element in a descending order array.
3) Order Agnostic BS.py : You are unaware of the Array order, so first check it and then find the given element
